Hi! This is my project for CS50x.

The idea behind this project is to create an online platform for the College of Dentistry at the university I am studying in. By the way, I am a 6th Year Dentistry Student.

This web application allows students and faculties to automate their tracking of schedules and other instances online. Which is beneficial because it is online, simple, and accessible. It is also a platform for the public to make requests for the College of Dentistry and students may check upon these requests and accept them. These features helpful for the current state of the College.

Like many others, I decided to take Harvard's CS50x course because of the quarantine (2020 COVID). I have always been passionate about computers in general since way before. CS50 had again, sparked my interest in computer science.

What's next?
CS50's Web Development with Python and Javascript
MORE PROGRAMMING COURSES.

Thank you to Professor David J. Malan and the rest of the CS50 staff!
